This module generates server images like GameTracker does. Those images are dynamic, it means that they can change every time you load them
and also generates the code to share your server stats and a game server link using html tags or the tags that are used in the forums.

Also have an Admin side for image uploads only for png extensions and max 200KB filesize.
There are some sample images in the package.
